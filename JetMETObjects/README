This is a copy of CondFormats/JetMETObjects, to enable stand-alone use of
jet energy corrections.
Slight changes have been made to enable stand-alone compilation and to avoid name collisions.
In particular, the Workaround.h file contains some code emulating cmssw edm::LogError to
minimize required changes in other places of the code.

The JetResolution class is from JetMETCorrections/Modules (not the one in CondFormats/JetMETObject!),
whilst the JetResolutionObject class is from CondFormats/JetMETObjects

In future, it would be good to just cms-addpkg instead of maintaining our own copies.
